Information on easyPCE:

This is a course evaluation tool built in the spring of 2013 for COS 333 w/ Brian Kernighan by John Whelchel, Yacob Yonas, and  Matt Haake. It uses Django to run a MVC-style app. The data is scraped from a couple of different registrar websites.

Some files have not been updated in a long time. bugs.txt contains some bugs and features we had wanted to implement but never got a chance to.

Some known dependencies:
python
    django
    mysql-python
