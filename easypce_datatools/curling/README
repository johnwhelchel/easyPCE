Use a copy of working.py, contained in this directory, as the main curler now!
They changed the website layout/authentication process.

Information on updating database.

1st BACK UP DATABASE...

This scraper is such a pain. Don't run at night. Don't login in while it's running. Anyway,
mkdir a new spot in DATA for the files. cp the scraper there and run it. Make sure it works.
Check on it eventually, it'll go past how far we want it to, just make sure it gets the newest
semester. Then divide the files into advice and evaluation files using new directories.

Open up the parser, go to the parse_dir function and modify the directory to point
to one of the two sections you've made. Run it on both. This should enter all the
evaluation and advice data.
