BUGSSSSSSS



For dept page, make sortable, add ratings info, add more to prof tab. Or eliminate prof tab?

there is something wrong with the way we handle courses like GER 1025...

add to regis parser ability to not add cancelled classes

use CDN first for jquery? <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>

serach results page on mozilla firefox borken can't scroll

we need to adjust adding favorites, currently too wasteful...ie I have cos 126 favorited "three" times

do brackets around slashed-out crap

do we really need'home' on the nav  bar/ 'what's up'? cat it not just be depts and 'jlwhelch's favoites?

verify registrar links

do we want no-cache on every page?

make a better system then just saying failure when not going through CAs

one question in writing sem exceeds size of SVG..

we aren't differentiating between professors and preceptors??? how??
might be a little slow on department page (especially on large depts like WWS and POL for example)
-1 for department view is hacked to get rid of python bug

MAKE ALL CSS AND JS FILE LOCAL

search magic. click on a few courses. names don't match. Using old names. Should sort by semester
in search results page for pringitng title.

Dropdowns for Department/Favorites at top?

can writing courses say "sorry no adivce for writing courses" Plz


Add distribution areas and more from registrar_parser

Other things to add:
      to coursenum, add professor with highest overall (can be Num), update in save function




some strange behavior in professors:

     any netid with unicode from name will break; update manually? (457, 250)
     id=1724, "Course Head" guy needs to be fixed manually
